      <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC). Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.
      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.
      An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and an adult female is called a 'hen'.[10][11]

      Other terms are:

      'Biddy:' a newly hatched chicken[12][13]
      'Capon:' a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
      'Chick:' a young chicken[14]
      'Chook' /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia, informal)[15]
      'Cockerel:' a young male chicken less than a year old[16]
      'Pullet:' a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]
      'Yardbird:' a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]
      "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.[20]

      'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[21]

      Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or young mice.[28]

      The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[30]
      Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.

      Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.</p>
